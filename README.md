## FAQ

### How to launch a manually downloaded app on macOS?

To run an unsigned application on macOS, you need to dequarantine it using the command below:

```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./path/to/termtastic
```

### Application doesn't discover BLE devices on macOS

To use Bluetooth on macOS Big Sur (11) or later, you need to enable the Bluetooth permission for your terminal. You can
do it by going to **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy** → **Privacy** → **Bluetooth**, clicking the '+'
button, and selecting `Terminal` (or `iTerm` or whichever terminal application you use).

### Why emojis are glitching/tearing on my terminal?

If you are using `foot` terminal try to add these lines into your `foot.ini` config:

```ini
[tweak]
grapheme-width-method=wcswidth
```

The same named option exists in other terminals too. Check your terminal docs.

### Why do some emoji appear as squares in Windows Terminal??

Unfortunately, Windows Terminal cannot display some compound emoji such as 1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣, etc.
There is an issue in Github: https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/9708
